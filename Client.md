Title: BookWyrm BookClub

About: The purpose of the BookWyrm BookClub app is to give its users a place to concisely record and track their current reading lists, as well as add and delete books from each list. From college textbooks to late-night crime thrillers, our users can easily document their must-reads and wish lists in one location. Visit our About page for more information about our story!

About (Client): The "client" side of our application is written using React and Material UI. Our primary components are built out for our Users, BookLists, and Books to house all of the information provided by the Users. The intent of our design for our app was to be clean and functional, with a touch of character.
